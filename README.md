# Expscan
## Full blockchain explorer for Expanse chain

Expscan is an Expanse blockchain explorer built with NodeJS, Express and Gexp.

While there are one excellent Expanse blockchain explorers available (gander.tech) they operate on a fixed subset of Expanse networks, usually the mainnet and testnet. Currently there are no network agnostic blockchain explorers available. If you want to develop Dapps on a private testnet or would like to launch a private / consortium network, Expscan will allow you to quickly explore such chains.
